Steps:
1) Identify PR to merge (current branch or most recent done issue PR).
2) Ensure tests pass locally and PR checks are green.
3) Update docs/README.md; append CHANGELOG.md.
   Update shared files via flock:
   ```bash
   ROOT="$(bash scripts/worktree.sh root)"
   bash scripts/flock_edit.sh "$ROOT/STATUS.md" -- bash -c '<update command>'
   ```
4) Merge via `gh pr merge` (merge/squash per repo rules) and delete branch.
5) Clean up worktree if one exists for this branch.
   **CRITICAL**: `cd` and `remove` MUST run in a single shell command.
   A child process `cd` cannot change the parent shell's CWD, so if they
   are separate calls the shell CWD remains in the deleted directory and
   ALL subsequent commands (including hooks) will fail.
   ```bash
   cd "$(bash scripts/worktree.sh root)" && bash scripts/worktree.sh remove <branch>
   ```
6) Post-merge smoke on main (optional).

## Shared Registry Files
**IMPORTANT**: Never commit `issues.md`, `STATUS.md`, or `CHANGELOG.md` to the feature branch.
These are registry files managed only on main. Always use `$ROOT/` path with `flock_edit.sh`.

## Error Handling
- Pre-merge checks (must all pass before merging):
  1. `gh pr checks <pr>` — all CI checks must be green.
  2. Local test suite must pass.
  3. PR must not be in draft state.
  If any check fails: stop and report which check failed.
- If `gh pr merge` fails: report the error (e.g., merge conflicts, branch protection rules).
- If post-merge smoke test fails on main:
  1. Immediately alert the user with the failing test output.
  2. Suggest `git revert -m 1 <merge_commit>` to revert the merge.
  3. Do NOT auto-revert without user confirmation.

## Rollback
- If merge must be reverted:
  1. `git revert -m 1 <merge_commit_sha>` on main.
  2. Push the revert commit.
  3. Update CHANGELOG.md with a revert entry.
  4. Update STATUS.md to reflect the reverted state.
- Branch is already deleted after merge; if rework is needed, create a new branch from the revert.
