Steps:
1) Find PR from issues.md (PR field) or `gh pr status`.
2) Checkout the PR branch in a worktree:
   ```bash
   BRANCH="$(gh pr view <pr_number> --json headRefName -q .headRefName)"
   WT="$(bash scripts/worktree.sh create "$BRANCH")"
   ```
   All subsequent file operations happen inside `$WT/`.
3) Ask reviewer subagent to perform code review + security audit:
   - Code quality: correctness, edge cases, maintainability, complexity, test coverage.
   - Security: injection, auth issues, hardcoded secrets, dependency CVEs, input validation, XSS, misconfiguration.
   - Pass existing `docs/review_lessons.md` (if exists) as context so the reviewer can identify recurring patterns.
4) Apply minimal fixes for Critical/High security findings and code issues; re-run tests inside `$WT/`.
5) Update docs/review_notes.md (inside `$WT/`) with two sections:
   - **Code Review**: findings, changes, follow-ups.
   - **Security Findings**: severity-classified list with remediation steps.
5.5) Ask reviewer subagent to update `docs/review_lessons.md`:
   - Use `$ROOT/docs/review_lessons.md` with `flock_edit.sh` for safe concurrent modification.
   - Add new preventable patterns or increment frequency of existing ones.
6) Commit + push from `$WT/`.
7) If PR is draft and ready: `gh pr ready`.

## Shared Registry Files
**IMPORTANT**: Never commit `issues.md`, `STATUS.md`, or `CHANGELOG.md` to the feature branch.
These are registry files managed only on main. Always use `$ROOT/` path with `flock_edit.sh`.

## Error Handling
- If PR not found (issues.md has no PR field and `gh pr status` returns nothing): stop and report; suggest running `/implement` first.
- If reviewer subagent fails: retry once; if still failing, skip automated review and log a warning in docs/review_notes.md.
- If applied fixes break tests:
  1. Revert the fix commits: `git checkout -- <files>` for unstaged or `git revert HEAD` for committed changes (inside `$WT/`).
  2. Re-run tests to confirm the branch is back to a passing state.
  3. Log the failed fix attempt in docs/review_notes.md as a follow-up item.
- If `gh pr ready` fails: report the error but do not block — the PR can be manually marked ready.

## Rollback
- Review changes are commits on the existing PR branch.
- If review fixes must be fully undone: `git revert` the review commits (do not force-push).
- docs/review_notes.md is append-only; no rollback needed for notes.
- Clean up worktree when done: `cd "$(bash scripts/worktree.sh root)" && bash scripts/worktree.sh remove "$BRANCH"`.
