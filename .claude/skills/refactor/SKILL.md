description: Improve code structure without changing behavior, then create a GH Issue + PR.
argument-hint: [file or module path to refactor]
disable-model-invocation: false

Steps:
1) Ensure `gh` authenticated (`gh auth status`).
2) Read the target file or module from $ARGUMENTS.
3) Read existing tests for the target to understand current behavior.
4) Identify code smells (long functions, duplication, deep nesting, tight coupling, etc.).
5) Present a prioritized list of proposed refactorings with rationale.
6) After user approval, create worktree for the branch:
   ```bash
   WT="$(bash scripts/worktree.sh create refactor/<slug>)"
   ```
   All subsequent file operations happen inside `$WT/`.
7) Apply refactorings one at a time inside `$WT/`, running tests after each step.
8) Confirm all tests pass after the final change.
9) Create GH Issue:
    - `gh issue create --title "refactor: <concise description>" --body "<body>"`
    - Body must include: identified code smells, applied refactoring patterns, affected files, and test results.
10) Commit + push (from `$WT/`).
11) Create PR:
    - `gh pr create --title "refactor: <concise description>" --body "Closes #<issue_number>\n\n<details>"`
12) Report the PR URL to the user — continue with `/review` and `/ship`.

## Error Handling
- If `gh auth status` fails: stop and instruct the user to run `gh auth login`.
- If no tests exist for the target: warn the user and suggest writing tests before refactoring.
- If tests fail after a refactoring step: revert the step and report the issue. Do NOT push or create PR.

## Rollback
- **CRITICAL**: `cd` and `remove` MUST run in a single shell command (`&&`).
  A child process `cd` cannot change the parent shell's CWD — separate calls
  leave the shell in a deleted directory, breaking all subsequent commands.
- If failure occurs after worktree creation but before PR:
  1. `cd "$(bash scripts/worktree.sh root)" && bash scripts/worktree.sh remove <branch>`
  2. `git push origin --delete <branch>` (remote cleanup, if pushed)
- If failure occurs after PR creation: `gh pr close <pr_number>` then clean up worktree and branch as above.

## Shared Registry Files
**IMPORTANT**: Never commit `issues.md`, `STATUS.md`, or `CHANGELOG.md` to the feature branch.
These are registry files managed only on main. Always use `$ROOT/` path with `flock_edit.sh`.

## Guidelines
- Never change observable behavior — structure-only changes.
- Run tests after EVERY individual step — green-to-green transitions only.
- Keep each commit small and focused on one transformation.
- If test coverage is below 70% for the target code, warn the user and suggest adding tests first.
- If you discover a bug during refactoring, stop — file it as a separate issue.
- Use well-known refactoring patterns: Extract Method, Move Function, Replace Conditional with Polymorphism, Introduce Parameter Object.
